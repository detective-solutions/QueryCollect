# QueryCollet

## Purpose
This small but functional webservice was created to support the detective developer team in collecting free text
queries for a feature of their main product. The detective team believes in open source and therefore the structure of
this little webservice is free. We also plan to provide the resulting dataset as open source asset to all of you, once 
detective has enough free text queries collected and a cleaned version of the data the dataset. So you don't have to
go through the same struggle. Please feel free to contribute to the service.

## Technology
You can run the service fully on docker. However, make sure to create a `.env` file containing the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`.
